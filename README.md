[![pre-commit](https://img.shields.io/badge/pre--commit-enabled-brightgreen?logo=pre-commit&logoColor=white)](https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit)

The project contains notes and proofs as Jupyter notebooks, as well as, Python code implementing algorithms as presented in the book "Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning" by Christopher Bishop.

## Instructions

In order to run the notebooks locally type the following:

```bash
make install
make jupyter
```

To generate a PDF document from the notebooks just type:

```bash
make notes
```

To generate markdown documents from the notebooks just type:

```bash
make markdown
```
